## Spent time

<4h. I was working on this project for one day with breaks on my other tasks. 
P.S. I was working using the touchpad as my mouse is broken :D

## Technologies
I used 'create-react-app' and 'redux-starter-kit' to bootstrap the project.
I know 'redux-starter-kit' allows to mutate data inside the reducers created with their `createReducer()` function
but I decided to go with the standard approach (immutability) because it's very specific to this package and it would not work without that.


I prefer to use flow or typescript because it's more powerful and strict than prop-types but I used prop-types here because you guys use it on your project.


At my previous job our team decided not to use containers to `connect` components, instead of that
we had `connect` directly in each component where we need to. This gives us a performance boost and we can
avoid passing a large number of props through components which don't use them. But here I used containers
because I did not want to risk and went with a standard approach.

I like and use CSSModules (sass), I guess it's the best solution for styles for now.


## Components
The structure is quite simple. The main components are `AppliedFilters`, `Filters` and `FilterItem`.
The `FilterItem` component is used in two places to avoid code duplicating.


## Tests
Sorry but I don't have much time now to write tests. I'm not a guru in writing tests but I know how to write them and know 
that it's really important.

## Last words
I'm a quick learner and motivated developer who really wants to work with you on such a big project as Nectar is.
I'm happy to learn new things and different approaches. I want to be useful. 

At my previous job (online game) I was working on really complicated things, such as Poker, various statistic pages,
and other staff with a lot of logic and user interactions. I'm sure If you hire me, you will be satisfied with my work.

Thanks!
